                                        multiple bodies within it. When we want multiple bodies to
                                        have the same properties such as shape and size and
                                        behave in a certain manner, we make a composite of
                                        these bodies.
                                        In our game, the rope we are creating is made up of
                                        multiple rectangles, hence we call it a composite. But we
                                        also have to add our fruit in the same composite.
                                        To add a body to the composite, we use the function,
                                        Matter.Composite.add(name_of_composite,
                                        body_to_add)
                                        */
  Matter.Composite.add(rope.body,fruit);

  fruit_con = new Link(rope,fruit);

  
 
  rectMode(CENTER);
  ellipseMode(RADIUS);
  textSize(50)
}

function draw() 
{
  background(51);
  
  rope.show();
